# People Pattern Insights API

The People Pattern API enables developers to use People Pattern
audience intelligence and model predictions in your applications.
We provide access to our Person Based Dataset (PDB) and machine
learning-based models which we use in the
[People Pattern](http://peoplepattern.com) dashboard application.

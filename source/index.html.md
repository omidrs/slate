# People Pattern Audience Intelligence API

The People Pattern Audience Intelligence API enables you to use People Pattern's
audience intelligence and model predictions within your application.
We provide access to our Portrait Database (Pdb) and machine
learning-based models which we use in the
[People Pattern](http://app.peoplepattern.com) application.
